          <p>The Solciety is founded on the principles of free love and respect. Everyone has a different take on love, therefore we let you decide how the mating games go. Solmates are 6,999.9 hand drawn, algorithmically generated characters based on anime style artwork. Myer-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is introduced as spirit animals of our Solmates to calculate compatibility. Interact in The Solciety and do some Sol-searching to help our Solmates find each other. </p>
